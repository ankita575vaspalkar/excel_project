☕ Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis

📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes over 149,000 coffee shop transactions to uncover business insights and improve decision-making across multiple store locations. The data includes detailed information such as transaction time, quantity sold, pricing, store location, and product attributes (category, type, and detail).

🔑 Key Insights

Top-Selling Products: Identifies the most popular product types and variants (e.g., Drip Coffee, Hot Chocolate, Chai Tea).

Peak Sales Hours: Analyzes time-of-day performance to optimize staffing and promotional efforts.

Location-Based Trends: Compares performance across store locations (e.g., Lower Manhattan, etc.), highlighting which stores contribute most to revenue.

Customer Preferences: Reveals product preferences by category (Coffee, Tea, Chocolate) to better tailor inventory and marketing.

Price Sensitivity: Correlates unit prices with quantities sold to assess customer sensitivity and potential pricing opportunities.

💡 Business Impact
This analysis can help:

Optimize product offerings based on actual sales trends.

Increase operational efficiency by aligning staffing with peak traffic hours.

Enhance customer satisfaction by focusing on preferred products.

Drive revenue growth through data-informed pricing and inventory strategies.

Localize marketing efforts based on store-specific performance.

🌟 What Makes This Project Stand Out

High Granularity: Each transaction includes timestamped data, allowing for deep temporal analysis.

Multi-Dimensional View: Combines product, pricing, quantity, time, and location—supporting a rich multi-factor analysis.

Scalable for BI Tools: Ideal for building dashboards in Power BI or Tableau for real-time business monitoring.

Data-Driven Strategy Design: Enables concrete, data-backed recommendations for promotions and product launches.
